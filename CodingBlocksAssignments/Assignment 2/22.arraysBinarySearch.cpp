/*Take as input N, the size of array. Take N more inputs and store that in an array. Take as input a number M. Write a function which returns the index on which M is found in the array, in case M is not found -1 is returned. Print the value returned.You can assume that the array is sorted, but youâ€™ve to optimize the finding process. For an array of size 1024, you can make 10 comparisons at maximum.

1.It reads a number N.
2.Take Another N numbers as input in Ascending Order and store them in an Array.
3.Take Another number M as input and find that number in Array.
4.If the number M is found, index of M is returned else -1 is returned.Print the number returned.*/
